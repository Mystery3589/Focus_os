1. still the issue is not resolved in andiroid.

2. Treat the google drive as main storage area instead of backup.

3. Upgrade the habit analytics. and once a habit is marked as done, do not let it be undone for the date.

4. Add a page - workout page and its analytics page.

5. Workout page description:-

The workout page should show today's day and today's focusing muscles and area. and suggest the workout excersices and warmup with how many sets and how much to complete a set. if marked complete add a pop up which asks very easy / easy / normal / difficult / very difficult. and adjust the excersice accordingly. also should have an option of disabled (not having one or both arm, not having one or both legs) and adjust the excersices accordingly, and also should have a option of current height and weigth and goal height and weight so the excerscises are adjusted accordingly. in short all the fitness stuff.

6. Workout analytics:- 

Should be advanced, track how much calories burnt and streaks and best hours(around which i mark the excersice complete.) and track my progress should have visuals too. what is my current limit. amnd how much far i am from my goal and how much time it will take for me to reach my goal(goal weight and height.). suggests calories intake and also should have a calorie burnout calculator. have avg. and percentage.
